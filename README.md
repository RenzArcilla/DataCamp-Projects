# DataCamp-Projects

Welcome! This repository contains my completed portfolio projects from [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/), where I’ve practiced real-world data analysis, data engineering, and product analytics skills. Each project focuses on building proficiency with Python, SQL, data pipelines, and exploratory data analysis.

## Notes

Some of the original datasets were only accessible through DataCamp’s project environment. When possible, I’ve exported data or created mock equivalents for use outside the platform.
